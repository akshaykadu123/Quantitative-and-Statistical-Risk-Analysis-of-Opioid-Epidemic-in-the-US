EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / ABSTRACT

The purpose of this project is to quantify and evaluate specified potential risks associated with the use of opioids, which are very commonly prescribed drugs or painkillers. The value in this research is the potential mitigation of the risk due to overdose from opioid consumption, a rising epidemic in the United States. 

Analysis is done using different statistical and quantitative risk analysis methods such as Bayesian Modeling, Data Wrangling, Distribution Analysis, Data Correlation, Predictive Modeling, and Fault tree to better identify patterns and therefore potential risk factors.

Tools Used: Python, JMP, Minitab, Agena Risk, MS Excel
